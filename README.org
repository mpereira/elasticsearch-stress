** Development
   Work on elasticsearch-stress is mostly done on Emacs. The workflow looks
   like:
   1. A CIDER session is started with =M-x cider-jack-in=
   2. Code is evaluated with with =cider-eval-sexp-at-point= or
      =cider-eval-buffer=
   3. Tests are run with =cider-test-run-test= or =cider-test-run-ns-tests=

*** Requirements
    - Java
    - leiningen
    - GraalVM (with its binaries in the PATH and the native-image utility installed)

*** Running tests
    #+begin_src bash
    lein test
    #+end_src

*** Building uberjar
    #+begin_src bash
    lein do clean, uberjar
    #+end_src

*** Prepend GraalVM binaries to PATH
    #+begin_src bash
    export PATH=$GRAALVM_HOME/bin:$PATH
    #+end_src

*** Building native image
    #+begin_src bash
    native-image \
      --initialize-at-build-time \
      --report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime \
      --no-fallback \
      --verbose \
      -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces \
